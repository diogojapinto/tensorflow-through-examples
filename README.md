# Tensorflow Through Examples
Tensorflow iterative tutorial for Tensorflow

First of all, I want to clarify that these examples are (at least currently), extensively based on the examples at [this](https://github.com/aymericdamien/TensorFlow-Examples) repository by [Aymeric Damien](https://github.com/aymericdamien) and [this](https://github.com/nlintz/TensorFlow-Tutorials) by [Nathan Lintz](https://github.com/nlintz) (to whom I have to thank by helping me in my Tensorflow endeavours).

These examples are intended for someone with already some knowledge about deep learning, but want to get technical and develop some more the knowledge in the field through a bottom-up perspective.

They are intended to be followed sequentially, by copying and thinking through what is being done. There is some overlap between examples, intended to "mechanize" the overall interaction with the library API.

## Setup

Install in your python environment the Tensorflow library (instructions in the [official site](https://www.tensorflow.org/)), as well as Jupiter notebook (instructions [here](https://ipython.org/notebook.html)).

## Topics

 * 1 - Essential Tensorflow API
 * 2 - Basic classifiers using Tensorflow
 * 3 - Common deep learning models (scaled for laptop)
 * 4 - Analyze model through the Tensorboard

## Support

I'll try to make the examples more cohesive, as well as introduce a 5th topic, with more advanced models. For the time being, the exercises talked about in the [Deep Learning Udacity course](https://www.udacity.com/course/deep-learning--ud730) are a very good follow up.
